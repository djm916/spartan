<a id="intro"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>

<h3>What is Spartan?</h3>
<p>Spartan is an experimental Lisp dialect based on Scheme, a minimal and elegant programming language used widely in computer science pedogogy.
To learn Scheme, the canonical source is "Structured Interpretation of Computer Programs", commonly referred to as "SICP" or "The Wizard Book".
For technical reference, the standard "Revised^N Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme", or simply "RNRS". The current revision is R7RS.
Spartan was created primarily for the author's own education into Scheme and functional programming.
</p>

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
This document specifies the design and implementation of a Scheme-like language (Spartan) into bytecode instructions for a virtual machine.
All of Scheme's major features are included: S-expression based syntax, first-class anonymous procedures, lexical closures,
proper tail recursion, metaprogramming via macros, first-class continuations, etc.
The compilation method and instruction set design are based on the heap model given in "Three Implementation Models for Scheme".
The virtual machine design is based on the "CEK" abstract machine model.
</p>

The host language is Java (JDK 17+), so for readers to understand the implementation, a familiarity with Java is assumed.


However, Spartan is not properly a Scheme, since it does not conform to any Scheme standard and the design differs in many ways. Most notable are:

<ul>
  <li>No pairs: There is no pair data type. Instead, the fundamental data type is the (proper) list. A pair is simply a list of 2 elements.</li>
  <li>Numbers: There is a full numeric tower, but there is no distinction between extact and inexact numbers.</li>
  <li>Macros are not hygenic: a defmacro special form is provided, but there is no facility for define-syntax, syntax-case, etc.</li>
  <li>Packages: symbols are organized into distinct namespaces.</li>  
</ul>

</p>

<a id="chapter_1"><h2>Basic Concepts</h2></a>

<p>This section is intended for those that may not be familiar with the
technical jargon used in Scheme. It provides a brief introduction to the
essential terminology, which is used throughout.</p>

<h3>Values and Types</h3>

<p>A <i>value</i> is a unit of data. Every value has a <i>type</i>.
Examples of value types include: number, text, list, function, etc. In
general, operations will have restrictions on what types are acceptable as input
parameters, depending upon the specific operation involved. It is an error to invoke
any operation on value types which the operation does not accept.</p>

<h3>Expressions and Evaluation</h3>

<p>Programs are composed of <i>s-expressions</i>.
S-expressions are a simple, unambiguous syntax for representing code as well as data.
Expressions that represent code can be <i>evaluated</i>, producing a <i>value</i>.
The program is executed by evaluating these expressions according to language's semantics:
the set of rules that determines how each form of expression is reduced to a value.</p>

<h3>Variables, Scope, and Environments</h3>

<p>A <i>variable</i> is a name that refers to a value. Variables are mutable,
meaning that they may be updated to refer to a different value at any time.
Mutability of variables is distinct from mutability of values: while variables
are always mutable, the values they refer to may or may not be. Variables do
not have a specific type, and may refer to values of any type.</p>

<p>The <i>scope</i> of a variable refers to the extent of its visibility in
the code, i.e., a set of expressions where the variable is <i>bound</i>
(initialized to a value). There are two types of variables: global
and local. Global variables have global scope, so are bound throughout the
program. Local variables have limited scope, restricted to a specific subset of
expressions.</p>

<p>An <i>environment</i> is a mapping from variables to values. In other words, a function from a variable to its associated value.
During evaluation of an expression, the current environment stores the current values of all variables in the scope of the expression.
References to variables that occur within the expression evaluate to the value associated with the variable in the current environment.
It is an error to refer to an unbound variable.</p> 

<a id="chapter_2"><h2>Types</h2></a>

<h3>Void</h3>

<p>The <i>void</i> value, denoted <code>void</code> is the singular value of type <i>void</i>.
It signifies the absence of any meaningful value.</p>

<h3>Boolean</h3>

<p>The boolean values, denoted <code>true</code> and <code>false</code> are the basic
units of logical operations.</p>

<h3>Symbols</h3>

<p>A <i>symbol</i> is a unique value denoted by a name (i.e., a string of characters).
All identical names denote the same unique symbol. unique named constant value.
A symbol is not a variable, but symbols are used to denote variables within expressions.
Unlike a variable, whose value usually changes with each evaluation of an expression, a symbol
never changes -- it always denotes itself.</p>

<h3>Numeric</h3>

<p>The numeric types are <i>integer</i>, <i>rational</i>, <i>real</i>  and <i>complex</i>.
The set of numeric types forms a natural heirarchy of subtypes: every integer is rational, every rational is real, and every real is complex.
Many, but not all, mathematical operations will accept arguments of any numeric type.</p>

<h3>Lists</h3>

<p>A <i>list</i> is an ordered sequence of zero or more values, denoted<p>

<div class = "codeblock"><pre>
(<i>x<sub>1</sub></i> ... <i>x<sub>N</sub></i>)
</pre></div>

<p>The empty list is denoted <code>()</code>.</p>

<h3>Functions</h3>

<p><i>Function</i>s are fundamental in any language. They are one of the primary
means of abstraction and composition. They may be pure or effectful. Functions are
first-class, and may be passed freely to and returned from other functions. Functions are
lexical closures, meaning they capture the values of the free variables in their scope.<p>

<h3>Strings</h3>

<p>A <i>string</i> is an immutable sequence of zero or more Unicode characters.
A <i>string literal</i> is a sequence of Unicode characters encoded directly in the source text.
This encoding may (optionally) be specified; the default is UTF-8.</p>

<p>String literals are delimited with double quotes (<code>"</code>). Inside a
string literal, the following escape sequences have special meaning:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>\u{xxxx}</code>, where x is a hexadecimal digit, denotes the Unicode character whose code point is equal to the specified value.</li>
  <li><code>\n</code> denotes the newline character.</li>
  <li><code>\t</code> denotes the tab character.</li>
  <li><code>\\</code> denotes a literal <code>\</code></li>
  <li><code>\"</code> denotes a literal <code>"</code></li>
</ul>

<h3>Ports and Bytes</h3>

<p>A byte is the lowest common denominator unit of data at the interface
between Spartan and external devices, such as memory and disk. In Spartan,
all I/O operations are done via a <i>port</i>, which transfers <i>bytes</i>
between Spartan and an external device. Spartan values may be converted to
<i>bytes</i> and vice-versa to allow for data persistence.</p>

<h3>Promises</h3>

<p>Promises, along with the operators <code>delay</code> and <code>force</code>
provide a simple interface to support lazy evaluation. The operator
<code>delay</code> accepts an expression (which is not immediately evaluated),
and returns a promise to return its value. The counterpart operator, <code>force</code>,
accepts a promise and evaluates the original expression, in the context of its
original environment, and returns the result. The expression is guaranteed to
only be evaluated once.</p>

<a id="chapter_3"><h2>Expressions</h2></a>

<h3>Variables</h3>

<p>Symbols in a program denote either a variable reference or a variable binding, depending on the context in which they appear.
Symbols denote variable bindings in contexts such as definitions and function parameter lists.
If not in a binding context, a symbol denotes a variable reference.
It is always an error to refer to an unbound variable.</p>

<h3>Conditionals</h3>

<p>A conditional expression of the form</p>
<div class="codeblock">
(if <i>exp<sub>1</sub></i> <i>exp<sub>2</sub></i> <i>exp<sub>3</sub></i>)
</div>
<p>first evaluates <i>exp<sub>1</sub></i>. If the result is true, <i>exp<sub>2</sub></i> is evaluated and its value is returned.
Otherwise, <i>exp<sub>3</sub></i> is evaluated and its value is returned. If <i>exp<sub>3</sub></i> is not given and <i>exp<sub>1</sub></i> is <code>false</code>,
void is returned.</p>

<h3>Sequencing</h3>

<p>An expression sequence</p>
<div class="codeblock">
(do <i>exp<sub>1</sub></i> ... <i>exp<sub>N</sub></i>)
</div>
<p>evaluates each <code><i>exp</i></code> in order from 1 to <i>N</i>. The
value of <code><i>exp<sub>N</sub></i></code> is returned as the result of the
entire expression.</p>

<h3>Let Expressions</h3>

<p>A let expression binds a set of local variables in a new environment and
evaluates its body expression in the context of that environment. There are
three forms: basic, sequential, and recursive.</p>

<p>The basic let expression has the form</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>
(let ((<i>var<sub>1</sub></i> <i>init<sub>1</sub></i>) ...) <i>body</i> ...)
</pre></div>

<p>The basic form is evaluated as follows: First, the <i>init</i> expressions are evaluated in the current environment (in some unspecified order).
Then the current environment is extended with <i>var<sub>i</sub></i> bound to the value of <i>init<sub>i</sub></i>.
Finally, the <i>body</i> expressions are evaluated in sequence in the extended environment and the result is returned as the value of the entire expression.
</p>

<p>The sequential form</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>
(let* ((<i>var<sub>1</sub></i> <i>init<sub>1</sub></i>) ...) <i>body</i> ...)
</pre></div>

<p>is semantically equivalent to the series of nested let expressions</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>
(let ((<i>var<sub>1</sub></i> <i>init<sub>1</sub></i>))
  (let ((<i>var<sub>2</sub></i> <i>init<sub>2</sub></i>))
    ...
    (let ((<i>var<sub>N</sub></i> <i>init<sub>N</sub></i>))
      <i>body</i>)))
</pre></div>

<p>The bindings are performed sequentially, so any <i>init<sub>j</sub></i> may
refer to any previous binding <i>var<sub>i</sub></i>, where <i>i < j</i>.</p>

<p>A recursive let expression has the form<p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>
(letrec ((<i>var<sub>1</sub></i> <i>init<sub>1</sub></i>) ...) <i>body</i> ...)
</pre></div>

</p>and is evaluated as follows: First, the current environment is extended with each <i>var</i> bound to an undefined value.
Then, each <i>init<sub>i</sub></i> is evaluated (in some unspecified order) and bound to the corresponding <i>var<sub>i</sub></i> in the extended environment.
Finally, the <i>body</i> expressions are evaluated in sequence in the extended environment and the result is returned as the value of the entire expression.</p>

<p>The recursive form allows the definition of self-recursive and sets of
mutually-recursive functions. Each <i>init</i> is typically a lambda expression,
but need not be. The only requirement is that no <i>init</i> expression refer to
any <i>var</i> before it has been initialized.</p>

<h3>Function Application</h3>

<p>The form</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>
(<i>f</i> <i>arg<sub>1</sub></i> ... <i>arg<sub>N</sub></i>)
</pre></div>

denotes the application of the function <i>f</i> to the arguments <i>arg<sub>i</sub></i>.
It is an error if <i>f</i> does not evaluate to a function or if the number of arguments <i>N</i> does not match the formal parameters of <i>f</i>.

<h3>Lambdas</h3>

<p>Functions are defined by "lambda" expressions. The term lambda comes from the lambda calculus, where the Greek symbol lambda was used to denote a function.
An expression of the form</p>

<div class="codeblock">
(fun (<i>var<sub>1</sub></i> ... <i>var<sub>N</sub></i>)
  <i>body</i>...)
</div>

<p>evaluates to a new function <i>f</i> with N parameters. The scope of the <i>body</i>
includes all variables in the scope of the lambda expression in addition to the formal parameters.
When <i>f</i> is applied to arguments <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>, <i>body</i> is evaluated in the environment of the lambda expression,
extended with <i>var<sub>i</sub></i> bound to the argument <i>x<sub>i</sub></i>.</p>

<a id="chapter_4"><h2>Proper Tail Recursion</h2></a>

<p>In functional programming, iteration is typically expressed by recursive
function calls. In general, each call consumes space on the system call stack,
and an excessive number of active calls can result in unbounded consumption of
system stack space. However, calls that occur in <i>tail context</i> are
guaranteed <i>not</i> to cause unbounded consumption of space. Tail context is
defined inductively as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The body of a function always occurs in tail context.</li>
  <li>If a conditional occurs in tail context, then both its branches occur in tail context.</li>
  <li>If a let binding occurs in tail context, then its body occurs in tail context.</li>
  <li>If a sequence occurs in tail context, then the last expression in the sequence occurs in tail context.</li>
  <li>No other expression occurs in tail context.</li>
</ul>

<a id="chapter_5"><h2>Virtual Machine</h2></a>

<p>The Spartan virtual machine design is based on a CESK machine, modified to support a Scheme-like programming language.
The CESK machine is based on the CEK machine, an abstract machine model for evaluating the lambda calculus.
The lambda calculus, including lambda expressions, applications, and variables, is sufficient to support functional programming.
The CESK machine extends the CEK machine with a store, to support mutable variables. The CESK machine has 4 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>C: control, the current expression being evaluated</li>
  <li>E: environment, a mapping from variables to locations in the store S</li>
  <li>S: store, a mutable mapping from locations to values</li>
  <li>K: continuation, specifies what to do after evaluating C</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>In modern hardware parlance, the C component is analogous to the instruction pointer (IP), E is analogous to the stack,
S is analogous to the heap, and K is analogous to the call stack. In a tradional language like C, the call stack is used for both
activation frame records, and to store the values of parameters and local variables. In the CESK machine, these purposes are split</p>

<p>The Spartan virtual machine's state consists of 5 components:</p>

<ul>
  <li>RES: result, stores result of evaluated expressions</li>
  <li>CTL: control, the current instruction being executed</li>
  <li>ARG: arguments, evaluated procedure arguments list</li>
  <li>ENV: environment, head of the environment chain</li>
  <li>KON: continuation, head of the continuation chain</li>
</ul>

<p>In the CESK machine, the C component serves a dual purpose: it is either an expression to evaluate or a data value which is the result of evaluating an expression (the only values in the lambda calculus are functions).
In the Spartan VM, these purposes are split into to registers. The RES stores evaluation results, and the CTL register points to an instruction.

<p>Closures<p>
The function values created by lambda expressions are so-called lexical closures because they
retain values for the free variables in the body of the lambda. That is, lambda bodies are always evaluated with respect to their defining environment,
plus any parameters.
In the virtual machine, function values are represented by
a closure object: a pair containing 1) a pointer to the function's entry point, 2) a pointer to the function's defining environment.
When a function is called, the environment stored in the closure is extended with a frame for the parameters and made current before
evaluating the function body. When the function returns, the previous environment is restored.

<p>Environments and environment frames</p>
Conceptually, every expression is evaluated in the context of an environment, which stores the value of each variable in the expression.
In the virtual machine, an environment is represented as a linked list of environment frames.
Each environment frame contains 1) an array of parameter values, and 2) a pointer to its parent environment.
The parent pointer points to the environment of the nearest lexically enclosing lambda expression,
forming a chain of environment frames which is used to resolve variables in the body of the lambda expression.

<p>Continuation and continuation frames</p>
Conceptually, the continuation of a computation refers what happens after the current computation is complete.
In the virtual machine, the continuation is represented as a stack of continuation frames.
Each continuation frame on the stack represents a suspended function awaiting a result.
When a function is called, a new frame is pushed on the stack which records the virtual machine state required to resume execution after the call.
When the call returns, the continuation stack is popped, and the virtual machine's state is restored to the state saved just prior to the call.

<a id="chapter_8"><h2>Miscellaneous</h2></a>

<h3>Operators vs. Functions</h3>

<p>While an operator is conceptually equivalent to a function, there is subtle
syntactic difference between the two. For instance, the expression</p>

<div class="codeblock">
<i>x</i> &#x2A01; <i>y</i>
</div>

<p>denotes the immediate application of a binary function &#x2A01; to some
arguments <i>x</i> and <i>y</i>. However, the operator symbol &#x2A01 itself
does not syntactically denote a function, and the arguments <b>must</b>
be supplied immediately. <i>Operator literals</i> provide a concise way of
referring to any operator as a function. The operator literal expression</p>

<div class="codeblock">
op &#x2A01
</div>

<p>denotes the value of the (unary or binary) function that implements the operator &#x2A01;.</p>
 
<h3>Integer Division</h3>

<p>When the division operator <code>/</code> is applied to two integers,
it returns a real-valued approximation of the rational number.
The operators <code>//</code> and <code>%</code> perform integral division
and modulus (remainder after division), respectively.</p>

<h3>Short Circuit Boolean Operators</h3>

<p>The operators <code>and</code> and <code>or</code> always evaluate both
operands and return <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. The short circuit
boolean operators <code>andalso</code> and <code>orelse</code> may not evaluate
both operands if the result can be determined without doing so, and return
one of their operands, not necessarily a boolean-typed value. Specifically,
<code><i>x</i> andalso <i>y</i></code> is equivalent to
<code>if <i>x</i> then <i>y</i> else <i>x</i></code>, and 
<code><i>x</i> orelse <i>y</i></code> is equivalent to
<code>if <i>x</i> then <i>x</i> else <i>y</i></code>, except that <i>x</i>
is evaluated only once.</p>

<h3>Record and Tuple Selectors</h3>

<p>The <code>.</code> operator is used to retrieve an element of a tuple or
record. The expression <code><i>r</i>.<i>id</i></code> evaluates to the
value of the named element <i>id</i> in record <i>r</i>, and the expression
<code><i>t</i>.<i>i</i></code> evaluates to the <i>i</i>th element in tuple
<i>t</i>. It is an error if no such element exists.</p>

<h2>Programming Techniques</h2>

<h3>Modeling Objects</h3>

<p>Among other things, the closure property of functions allows one to model stateful objects and
methods. For example, consider a simple monotonically increasing counter, with
two associated operations: <i>value</i>, which gets the current value of the
counter, and <i>tick</i> which increments the counter. This can expressed as</p>

<div class="codeblock"><pre>
let Counter = \ ->
  let count = ref 0,
      value = \ -> val count,
      tick = \ -> set count (+ 1 (val count))
  in { value, tick };
  
let c = Counter();
(.value c)();  # 0
(.tick c)();
(.value c)();  # 1
</pre></div>

<p>This technique of modeling objects with functions easily extends to more
complex cases.</p>

<a id="appendix_1"><h2>Formal Grammar</h2></a>

<p>This section contains Spartan's complete formal grammar, specified in EBNF.
We use <b>bold</b> to designate terminals and <i>italics</i> to designate
non-terminals.<p>

<p>Following the grammar is a LL(1) conversion.</p>

<pre>
<i>exp</i> → <i>atom</i> | <b>(</b> <i>exp</i>* <b>)</b>
<i>atom</i> → <i>boolean</i> | <i>number</i> | <i>symbol</i> | <i>string</i>
<i>number</i> → <i>sign</i>? (<i>integer</i> | <i>rational</i> | <i>real</i> | <i>complex</i>)
<i>integer</i> → <i>digit</i>+
<i>rational</i> → <i>integer</i> <b>/</b> <i>integer</i>
<i>real</i> → <i>integer</i> <b>.</b> <i>integer</i> <i>exponent</i>?
<i>complex</i> → <i>real</i> <i>sign</i> <i>real</i> <b>i</b>
<i>exponent</i> → ( <b>e</b> | <b>E</b> ) <i>sign</i>? <i>integer</i>
<i>sign</i> → <b>+</b> | <b>-</b>
<i>digit</i> → <b>0</b> | <b>1</b> | ... | <b>9</b>
<i>symbol</i> → <i>qualified-id</i> | <i>id</i>
<i>qualified-id</i> → <i>id</i> <b>:</b> <i>id</i>
<i>id</i> → <i>id-start</i> <i>id-follow</i>*
<i>id-first</i> → a non-digit alphabetic or special character
<i>id-follow</i> → a alphabetic or special character
</pre>

<p>The grammar as given is ambiguous for easier understanding, but may easily be
converted to an unambiguous LL(1) grammar by removing left recursion and by
enforcing operator precedence in the grammar itself. This is left as an excercise
for the reader.</p>

<p>[1] Since the value bound to a variable is fixed, the term

traditional programming languages, in which a variable
